short term:

long term:
- make errors better
- use a templating library
- decide how flexible / intricate this should be
    * for one should you be able to make files out side the project dir
    * should i bother with fake root or something for the build script
    * maybe come up with a way to point to a directory to recreate
- make auto complete better
- maybe add include to build
- maybe refactor clap logic to be useful or get rid of it
- allow hiding stderr

test:
- refactor test suit
- make test for optional config variables
- make test for cli interface
- test for failures
    * there are templates that aren't in the file list
