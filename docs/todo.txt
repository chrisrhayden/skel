# TODO: find out if the top level variables need to be first

test:
- make test for optional config variables
- test for failures
    * there are templates that aren't in the file list

short term:
- make cli interface batter
- check if paths are relative or absolute
- cli args
- make from a directory
    * Project struct from directory
    * or just copy directory

long term:
- make config use a single project dir and look up the given name or alias from
  the file system
- better templating
    * use a templating library

notes:
- i dont like that Project::new is where defaults are set
