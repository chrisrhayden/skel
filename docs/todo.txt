short term:
- check if paths are relative or absolute and to not add / to the name if added
- add a way to not run build script or templates
- use a templating library

long term:
- remove template file if not making templates
- make errors better
- add a way to include a script to build or maybe a build method
  like makepkgs

test:
- make test for optional config variables
- make test for cli interface
- test for failures
    * there are templates that aren't in the file list

done:
- make NewInnerError methoids for from_io_error 
- add include file to config
