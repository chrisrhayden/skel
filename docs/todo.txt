short term:
- allow a way to run the build script before trying to do anything else
- use a templating library
- add cli arg to show/hide build output

long term:
- decide how flexible this should be
    * for one should you be able to make files out side the project dir
    * should i bother with fake root or something for the build script
- remove template file if not making templates
- make errors better
- make auto complete better
- maybe add include to build

test:
- refactor test suit
- make test for optional config variables
- make test for cli interface
- test for failures
    * there are templates that aren't in the file list

done:
- make SkelInnerError methods for from_io_error
- check if paths are relative or absolute and to not add / to the name if added
- add include file to config
- add a way to not run build script or templates
- put optional variables back in
